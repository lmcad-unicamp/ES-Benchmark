was unable to find any relevant network interfaces:

Module: OpenFabrics (openib)
  Host: ip-172-31-5-222

Another transport will be used instead, although this may result in
lower performance.

MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 14 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
with errorcode 0.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
