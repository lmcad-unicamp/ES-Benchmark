[[52428,1],615]: A high-performance Open MPI point-to-point messaging module
was unable to find any relevant network interfaces:

Module: OpenFabrics (openib)
  Host: ip-172-31-15-107

Another transport will be used instead, although this may result in
lower performance.

NOTE: You can disable this warning by setting the MCA parameter
btl_base_warn_component_unused to 0.

ERROR: Number of processes (768) is not a power of two (512?)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 690 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
with errorcode 16.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
